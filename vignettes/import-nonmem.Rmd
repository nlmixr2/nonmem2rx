The goal of `nonmem2rx` is to convert a NONMEM control stream to
`rxode2` for easy clinical trial simulation in R.

Here is a quick example of a conversion:

```{r model}
library(nonmem2rx)

# First we need the location of the nonmem control stream Since we are running
# an example, we will use one of the built-in examples in `nonmem2rx`
resFile <- system.file("mods/cpt/runODE032.res", package="nonmem2rx")
# You can use a control stream or the listing (.lst or .res) file

mod <- nonmem2rx(resFile, save=FALSE, determineError=FALSE)
mod
```

## Setting up `nonmem2rx` for your model

Some common options that you may want to change when importing NONMEM
control stream are:

- The default NONMEM output extension; By default it is `.lst`.  You
  can set it to something else, like `.res`, using the following
  option: `options(nonmem2rx.lst=".res")`.

- Turn on [extended control
  stream](https://wfn.sourceforge.net/wfncs.htm#control_streams)
  support, as used by Wings for NONMEM. You can turn it on by
  `options(nonmem2rx.extended=TRUE)`

You probably also want to change the name of parameters and
compartments. The easiest way to name the parameters whatever you want
is to pre-specify the names.  For example:

```{r prespecify}
mod <- nonmem2rx(system.file("mods/cpt/runODE032.ctl", package="nonmem2rx"), lst=".res", save=FALSE,
                 thetaNames=c("lcl", "lvc", "lq", "lvp", "prop.sd"),
                 etaNames=c("eta.cl", "eta.vc", "eta.q","eta.vp"),
                 cmtNames = c("central", "perip"))

mod
```

This checks the parameter names to make sure they are the same
length as the input names, if they are not, the model will skip parameter
renaming and keep the default translation names `theta#` and `eta#`.

As a note, `sigma` parameters are not currently renamed; So for the
following model (which grabs the parameter automatically labels to
generate variables), `sigma` is simply `eps#`.

```{r prespecifySigma}
mod <- nonmem2rx(system.file("Theopd.ctl", package="nonmem2rx"), save=FALSE)
mod
```

You can still rename however you wish, though, using model piping
(`rxRename()` or `dplyr::rename()` would both work):

```{r renameMod}
mod <- mod %>% rxRename(add.var=eps1)
mod
```

This model does not specify the residuals in a way that makes sense to
`nlmixr2`.  If you want, you can still [convert the `rxode2` model to
a nlmixr2 fit](https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/convert-nlmixr2.html).

## Technical details about reading NONMEM to rxode2

The key files to import are the NONMEM control stream (or related
file) and the NONMEM output (often with a `.lst` or `.res` extension).

The import process steps are below:

- Read in the nonmem control stream and convert the model to a
  `rxode2` ui function.

- Try to determine an endpoint/residual specification in the model (if
  possible), and convert to a fully qualified ui model that can be
  used in `nlmixr2` and `rxode2`. If it cannot be determined
  automatically, [you can manually fix this](https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/convert-nlmixr2.html) and
  still convert to a `nlmixr2` object (if the data/estimates are
  available of course).

- If available, `nonmem2rx` will read the final parameter estimates
  and update the model.

- The converter will read in the nonmem input dataset, and search for
  the output files with `IPRED`, `PRED` and the `ETA` values. The
  translated `rxode2` model is run for the population parameters and
  the individual parameters.  This will then compare the results
  between `NONMEM` and `rxode2` to make sure the translation makes
  sense.  This only works when `nonmem2rx` has access to the input
  data and the output with the `IWRES`, `IPRED`, `PRED` and the `ETA`
  values.

- Converts the upper case NONMEM variables to lower case (can be
  turned off with `nonmem2rx(..., toLowerLhs=FALSE))`)

- Replaces the NONMEM theta / eta names with the label-based names
  like an extended control stream (can be turned off with
  `nonmem2rx(thetaNames=FALSE, etaNames=FALSE)`)

- Replaces the compartment names with the defined compartment names in
  the control stream (ie `COMP=(compartmenName)`)
